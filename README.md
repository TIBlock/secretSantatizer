# Secret Santatizer

The Secret Santatizer is a Python web app designed for the user to create a list of Secret Santa participants and then email the participants their match. 

## Motivation

This project came out of wanting to have a Secret Santa gift exchange with some friends. I thought it might be a fun side project that gives me an excuse to create a Python web application. 

## Features
This is a list of features I would like to implement in this project:
- Create list of participants for a Secret Santa gift exchange.
- Mark which of the participants is in a couple to prevent them from being matched. (optional)
- Mail out matches to each participant anonymously.
  - This app will also mail the list creator anonymously. That way even they do not know who they matched with in the dawing. 

## Potential Features
This is a list of potential features to expand the web application:
- User accounts/authentication.
  - Save lists for reference and future use. 
  - Edit past lists.
  - Copy lists.
  - Share lists with other users. 
- Create a clickable link to allow people to input their information.
  - Could allow list makers to send out to their own mailing list and only log user's who want to participate.
  - Set a timer on the link so that it will expire after a certain period of time.
  - Reminder notification sent to the user when a certain amount of time is left before the link expires.
