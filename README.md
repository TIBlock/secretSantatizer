# secretSatatizer

The Secret Santatizer is a web app designed for the user to create a list of secret santa participants and email their Secret Santa match. 

## Motivation

This project came out of me wanting to have a Secret Santa with some friends. I thought it might be a fun side project that gives me an excuse to create a full stack python application. 

## Features
This is a list of features I would like to implement in this project:
- Create list of participants for a Secret Santa gift exchange.
- Mark which of the participants is in a couple to prevent them from being matched. (optional)
- Mail out matches to each participant anonymously.
  - This app will also mail the list creator anonymously. That way even they do not know who they matched with in the dawing. 

## Potential Features
This is a list of potential features to expand the web application:
- User accounts/authentication to allow user's to save lists.
  - Edit past lists.
